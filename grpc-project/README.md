# gRPC

REST stands for “REpresentational State Transfer.” It provides a set of guidelines on how to create web APIs. But that’s it, a set of guidelines. It does not try to enforce anything.

gRPC is a message-passing technique developed by Google. But the “g” in gRPC does not mean “google”; it’s actually pretty random. For example, the “g” in gRPC 1.12 stands for “glorious.”

gRPC is programming-language agnostic, and it seems to be the new trend in the microservices communication world. Compared to REST, gRPC provides greater performance at the expense of less flexibility.

So, gRPC does not provide a set of guidelines on how to create web APIs; it enforces rules. This time, the mailman would be very angry if you didn’t start the letter with a proper salutation!

That is its main advantage over REST: gRPC, in most cases, is way faster and more robust, as it defines a specific set of rules each request and response should adhere to.
