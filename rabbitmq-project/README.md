Suppose you want speak to your friend Adam and he is not around. What can you do? You can wait until Adam comes to you or you go to Adam. Or you give your message to Rabbit and be assured that the Rabbit will deliver the message safely to Adam. Rabbit can go a bit further, if it knows that Bob is also your friend, and may be interested in the message, it will deliver the message to Bob as well. All this happens even when none of them ever come in contact. You only have to deliver the message once to Rabbit. The friends have to maintain a good relationship with the Rabbit. They should regularly take messages that are meant for them.

Once the communication can happen this way, it can be taken a step further. You can even have communication with Cathy who may not speak the same language as you.
